User manual:

Running the program starts the game immediately.

Your objective is to complete as many orders in the time frame as possible

The main game may cover your order so move it accordingly for your play style.

There are 6 gray bars, each of which can hold any of the 10 ingredients

The controls to move your selection up are Arrow Up and/or “W”

The controls to move your selection down are Arrow Down and/or “S”

Your selection will have a black border outline

When you choose an ingredient, your selected space will become a color representing that ingredient, an example being red for ketchup.

Tomato is a lighter red (For accuracy) but can be mistaken for ketchup if not careful, this applies to other ingredients sharing the same color family.

Your order needs to be dead accurate to be correct from top to bottom, meaning if your order is 

Tomato

Burger

Ketchup

Mustard

Cheese

Pickle

Your stack must exactly match.

Once you believe your order is correct, Click submit.

The game will tell you if your order is correct or not on the order window

If your order is incorrect, it will tell you and you will have to fix it.

If your order is correct, the game will tell you and another “Order” window will appear, this is your new order.

DO NOT DELETE YOUR ORDER, IT WILL NOT COME BACK. 

Along with your order being correct, YOUR TIME WILL DECREASE FASTER

During your second order, time will decrease by 2, and during your third order by 3, and so on. This means you will have to improve fast if you want to get a higher score.

This is where extra key binds will come in handy, such as 1-0 on your keyboard

The key binds are as follows:

1 = Mayo
2 = Mustard
3 = Ketchup
4 = Lettuce
5= Onions
6 = Burger
7 = Pickle
8 = Cheese
9 = Bacon
0 = Tomato

If you DO NOT HAVE A NUMPAD, I would advise you to stick to your mouse.
